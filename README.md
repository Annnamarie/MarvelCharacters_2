## Notes

I have made quite a few updates from the last submission last week. Here, I did not only beautify the MarvelApp but using styles and theme but also re-did the search query feature so that it will clear the random or previous results first and only pull up the search results of that character. Before, the search results would end up at the end/bootom of the recycler view and you would need to scroll all the way down before seeing the results. I also applied the strech feature of dark-mode and made sure to change the font colors on the dark them so that it is readable.
